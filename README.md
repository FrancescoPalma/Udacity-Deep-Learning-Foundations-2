# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Foundations
**Project 2**
  
*INTRO*: This project was about building my first Convolutional Neural Network with Tensorflow to recognise and classify objects and images using the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.  
  
*SOLUTION*: The solution - with code and detailed comments - is available as HTML file to run in any browser and/or as Jupyter Notebook.
